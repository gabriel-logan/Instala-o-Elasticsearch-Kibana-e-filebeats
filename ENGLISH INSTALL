	HELLO WORLD, LETS GET START IT

Elasticsearch, Kibana and Filebeats basic installation and configurations - by LOGAN Comunidade Conecta

IMPORTANT: Make sure your system has Java packages installed, and Nodejs
apt for installation

apt install default-jdk
apt install nodejs

NOTE: LOCAL INSTALLATION

1 - Download ElasticSearch, Kibana, Filebeat
the folder does not care

all links are in the description

2 - Install elasticseach, start the service and check if the service is
running, curl localhost:9200 or open in browser localhost9200

then install kibana, start the service and check if it is running
systemctl status kibana.service

3 - Access the host with the specified port (localhost:5601 - DEFAULT), and create
default user with their own settings(kibana)

4 - When adding an integration

I will choose any

just for example 

(Missing security requirements), to solve this problem that will
appear when trying to add an integration, you will paste this command

xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.authc.api_key.enabled: true

in the elasticsearch.yml file

5 - Restart elasticsearch service and open browser on host:5601, you will
check that kibana is not initializing, as now the
security is active, it is necessary to create a user authentication to
access kibana

6 - To solve this problem, just in case, run an updatedb
and search for elasticsearch-setup-passwords using locate

7 - Run ./elasticsearch-setup-passwords auto (auto generates users
and passwords automatically (RECOMMENDED) ) to generate your own passwords
use elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive instead of "auto".

8 - Generated passwords, keep them in a safe place{
	Changed password for user apm_system
	PASSWORD apm_system = mGptdnPoDiyFrYsqLRzW

	Changed password for user kibana_system
	PASSWORD kibana_system = b4kxykfVRzh2LFgHDjYZ

	Changed password for user kibana
	PASSWORD kibana = b4kxykfVRzh2LFgHDjYZ

	Changed password for user logstash_system
	PASSWORD logstash_system = aZzyAIMTyVLVcVdKJxrW

	Changed password for user beats_system
	PASSWORD beats_system = YYr4aIIdUxfEnOgWADSq

	Changed password for user remote_monitoring_user
	PASSWORD remote_monitoring_user = Hm6mgebiH8jgwehCoh1V

	Changed password for user elastic
	PASSWORD elastic = mLLkuu4xEZEoiNgvtZp4

}

9 - Look for the kibana.yml file, activate the codes by removing the hashtags,
in 'pass' put the generated kibana_system password and save
#elasticsearch.username: "kibana_system"
#elasticsearch.password: ("pass" = FwdHpZCyrtVKDTfNSbIn)

10 - run the command kibana-keystore create

The Kibana keystore already exists. Overwrite? [y/n]
type y
YES

11 - add kibana-keystore to elastic.passwords

running ./kibana-keystore add elasticsearch.password

it will ask for the kibana_system password, you copy and paste.

12 - restart kibana

systemctl restart kibana.service

and check

systemctl status kibana.service

Everything is OK

13 - open the browser and access host:5601 the login page will already be created.

14 - log in with elastic username and password, as it is superuser

Elasticsearch and kibana are already working correctly, now all that's left is
install integrations that will filter specific information.

15 - install filebeat (I will use filebeat as an example).

16 - first thing, connect to elasticsearch, go to filebeat.yml,
search for output.elasticsearch and activate
  hosts: ["myEShost:9200"]
  username: "filebeat_internal"
  password: ("YOUR_PASSWORD" = elasticpassword(tXnHzWRekBAkelYjGDQ2))

17 - Now activate the collection modules, first check the modules that exist
with the filebeat modules list command

18 - activate the modules you want, I will activate nginx and system
with the command filebeat modules enable nginx
and filebeat modules enable system

19 - test the modules configuration with the command filebeat test config -e (RECOMMENDED)
(-e is optional and sends the output to standard error instead of the configured log output.)

Wait for CONFIG OK

20 - upload the modules to the settings with the command filebeat setup -e

21 - start filebeat service, systemctl start filebeat.service, refresh host page:5601

22 - if you go to Stack Management and then to Index Patterns you will see that the filebeat is already running
in kibana, now you can go to dashboard, create a new dashboard, select filebeat
and check some logs, thanks
